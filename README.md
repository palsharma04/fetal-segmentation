# fetal-segmentation
This repository showcases a complete deep learning pipeline for multi-label segmentation of fetal anatomical structures (fetus, placenta, umbilical cord, and amniotic fluid) in bSSFP MRI scans. It includes implementations of both 2D and 3D architectures using the nnU-Net and MONAI frameworks, enabling reproducible and scalable segmentation.
The project is designed for research and educational use, and aims to support clinical translation of automated fetal MRI analysis through open-source, benchmarked models.
