# fetal-segmentation
This repository showcases a complete deep learning pipeline for multi-label segmentation of fetal anatomical structures (fetus, placenta, umbilical cord, and amniotic fluid) in bSSFP MRI scans. It includes implementations of both 2D and 3D architectures using the nnU-Net and MONAI frameworks.
